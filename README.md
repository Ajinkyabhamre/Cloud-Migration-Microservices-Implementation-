# Cloud-Migration-Microservices-Implementation-
Architected a containerized microservices system on AWS ECS Fargate using Docker, decoupling a monolithic Node.js app into modular services with ALB path-based routing, reducing API latency by 40%. Automated CI/CD with CodePipeline, enabling blue-green deployments and cutting deployment time from 25 to 7 minutes. Migrated MySQL to Amazon RDS with IAM-based access control and VPC peering, achieving 60% cost savings. Deployed CloudFormation templates for IaC and applied auto-scaling and IP whitelisting, supporting 5,000+ users with sub-2s response times!
